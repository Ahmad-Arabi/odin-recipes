        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.</p>
        <p>Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 Pound) Flat Iron Steak.</li>
            <li>2 ½ Tablespoons Olive Oil.</li>
            <li>2 Cloves Garlic, minced.</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Chopped Fresh Parsley.</li>
            <li>¼ Teaspoon Chopped Fresh Rosemary.</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Chopped Fresh Chives.</li>
            <li>¼ Cup <del>Cabernet Sauvignon</del> Grape Juice.</li>
            <li>½ Teaspoon Salt.</li>
            <li>¾ Teaspoon Ground Black Pepper.</li>
            <li>¼ Teaspoon Dry Mustard Powder.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, <del>red wine</del> grape juice, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Sear and cook the steak in the hot skillet for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</li>
            <li>Discard the marinade. Allow the steaks to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
