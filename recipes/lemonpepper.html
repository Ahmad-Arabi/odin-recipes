        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The dish is prepared by roasting unbreaded chicken wings. After cooking, they are tossed in lemon pepper, a seasoning made with lemon zest and black pepper as well as other ingredients such as sugar. Many recipes use premade lemon pepper.</p>
        <p>Lemon pepper seasoning has a pungent aroma filled with zesty floral, citrus, and woody notes. The mixture has a sharp lemony flavor mixed with underlying umami nuances and a peppery bite that balances the bitter and sour notes of the lemon zest.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups oil, or as needed.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oi.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon-pepper seasoning.</li>
            <li>12 chicken wings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
