        <h2 class="sub-title">Description</h2>
        <p class="description">The dish is prepared by roasting unbreaded chicken wings. After cooking, they are tossed in lemon pepper, a seasoning made with lemon zest and black pepper as well as other ingredients such as sugar. Many recipes use premade lemon pepper.</p>
        <p class="description">Lemon pepper seasoning has a pungent aroma filled with zesty floral, citrus, and woody notes. The mixture has a sharp lemony flavor mixed with underlying umami nuances and a peppery bite that balances the bitter and sour notes of the lemon zest.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-title">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>2 cups oil, or as needed.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon <a href="./seasoning-lemonpepper.html">lemon-pepper seasoning</a>.</li>
            <li>12 chicken wings.</li>
        </ul>
