        <h2 class="sub-title">FAQs</h2>

        <h3 class="FAQs">Can I zest the lemon instead?</h3>
        <p class="description">Of course! Get that lemon peel off of the lemon however you want, I just find that peeling is so much easier, and faster.</p>

        <h3 class="FAQs">Can I use an oven instead of a dehydrator?</h3>
        <p class="description">Of course, but it will take longer, about 2-3 hours in the oven. Also if you like to make your own seasonings, then I can't recommend a good dehydrator, more.</p>

        <h3 class="FAQs">How much does this recipe make?</h3>
        <p class="description">1.65 oz <small>(47 grams)</small>, which is just a little less than what you get when you buy it jarred from the store.</p>

        <h3 class="FAQs">How long does it last?</h3>
        <p class="description">Fresh spices can technically last up to two years, however, over time they start to lose flavor. The best time frame for this lemon pepper is usually about 3-6 months. But you could also store it in the freezer for even longer!</p>
